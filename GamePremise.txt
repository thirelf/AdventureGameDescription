In this text-based escape room game, you play as a student studying magic at Cauldronia College Coolado. You had rented out a room to practice some spells in, but when you emerge, you realize, not only is everyone gone, but you seemed to be locked in by mysterious magic. You must type out the spells you know and utilize any items you find to unravel the strange forces that trap you inside and find your way out.
